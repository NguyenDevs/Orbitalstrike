# ==========================================
# Orbital Strike Cannon Configuration
# ==========================================
# This is the main configuration file for the Orbital Strike plugin.
# For individual cannon customization, edit "cannons.yml" instead.

settings:
  # Enable update notifications for server administrators
  update-notify: true

  # Automatically load the target chunk before firing to ensure strike success
  # Recommended: true (prevents strikes from failing in unloaded chunks)
  force-load-target: true

  # List of worlds where cannons can be activated
  # Add or remove world names to control where strikes are allowed
  enabled-worlds:
    - world
    - world_nether
    - world_the_end

  # Enable cannon trigger console log
  logs: true

# ==========================================
# Default Item Settings
# ==========================================
# These settings apply to all newly created cannons
# To customize individual cannons, edit "cannons.yml"

items:
  # Material type for the cannon item
  # Can be any valid Minecraft material (e.g., FISHING_ROD, STICK, BLAZE_ROD)
  material: FISHING_ROD

  # Enable item durability system
  # If true, the cannon item will break after reaching max-durability uses
  durability: true

  # Maximum number of uses before the item breaks
  max-durability: 1

  # Cooldown between uses in second
  # Set to -1 to disable cooldown
  cooldown: -1

# ==========================================
# Payload Type Settings
# ==========================================
# Configure the behavior of each payload type
# These are default values for newly created cannons

payloads:
  # ========================================
  # STAB Payload
  # ========================================
  # Creates a vertical pattern drilling down to bedrock
  stab:
    # Explosion power of each TNT (default Minecraft TNT is 4.0)
    yield: 8.0

    # Horizontal offset for the pattern (in blocks)
    offset: 0.3

    # Vertical distance between TNT spawns (in blocks)
    # Smaller values = more dense, larger values = more spread out
    vertical-step: 2

  # ========================================
  # NUKE Payload
  # ========================================
  # Spawns a massive array of TNT in concentric rings above the target
  nuke:
    # Explosion power of each TNT
    yield: 8.0

    # Height above target to spawn the nuke array (in blocks)
    # Higher values give TNT more time to spread before impact
    height: 60.0

    # Number of concentric rings in the nuke array
    # More rings = larger explosion radius
    rings: 10

    # Base amount of TNT in the innermost ring
    base-tnt: 20

    # Amount of additional TNT to add per ring
    # Ring 1 has base-tnt, Ring 2 has base-tnt + tnt-increase, etc.
    tnt-increase: 3

    # Fuse time in ticks before TNT explodes (20 ticks = 1 second)
    # Controls how long TNT stays suspended before launching
    fuse-ticks: 80

    # Delay before launching the TNT array downward (in ticks)
    # Longer delays allow more time to observe the formation
    launch-delay: 10

  # ========================================
  # RECURSION Payload
  # ========================================
  # Creates a chain reaction where each TNT splits into multiple TNTs
  recursion:
    # Explosion power of each TNT
    # Lower values recommended to prevent server lag
    yield: 10.0

    # Height above target to spawn the initial TNT (in blocks)
    height: 111.0

    # Number of recursion levels (to prevent infinite recursion)
    # Example with level 3:
    # - Level 1: 1 TNT splits into 'amount' TNTs
    # - Level 2: Each TNT splits into 'amount' TNTs
    # - Level 3: Final explosion (no more splitting)
    level: 3

    # Number of TNTs to spawn after each explosion
    # Total TNT count = amount^level (e.g., 5^3 = 125 TNTs at level 3)
    amount: 5

    # Velocity multiplier for the split TNTs
    # Higher values make TNTs spread faster and farther
    velocity: 0.8

    # Fuse time in ticks for the split TNTs (intermediate levels)
    # This applies to all levels EXCEPT the last level
    # Shorter fuse = faster chain reaction
    split-fuse-ticks: 20

    # Fuse time in ticks for the last level TNTs (final explosion)
    # This applies ONLY to the final level before explosion
    # Longer fuse gives time for TNTs to spread before detonating
    last-fuse-ticks: 60
